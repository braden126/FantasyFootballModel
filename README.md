# Fantasy Football Model

<p> Fantasy football is a very unpredictable hobby. This model is intended to use linear regression to help predict how many points a player will score per game for a season based
on how the player performed during the previous season. The model uses fantasy data from Pro-Football-Reference and per-play data from NFLScrapR</p>
